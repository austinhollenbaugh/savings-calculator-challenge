# Savings Calculator Challenge

## Task

Build a savings calculator in Javascript.

## Overview

Your challenge is to build a basic, yet interactive, savings calculator using Javascript. The purpose of a savings calculator is to help an individual see how money, invested over time, at an interest rate, added to monthly, grows exponentially. Simply Google "savings calculator" to find countless examples. For your challenge, ask the user for these inputs:

* Starting Amount
* Monthly Savings
* Years to Save
* Interest Rate

The outputs of the calculator should be the following:

* Total saved
* Interest earned
* Line graph showing annual savings with interest
* Line graph showing annual savings without interest (it's useful to see the difference)

Here is a proposed UI for the completed calculator:
